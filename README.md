  * [Pok√©mon Stats EDA:](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats%20EDA.ipynb) This dataset includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids.
  * [Ramen Ratings EDA:](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ramen-ratings-eda.ipynb) Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!
  * [Lokasi Mudik Karyawan (In Indonesian Language):](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Lokasi%20Mudik%20Karyawan.ipynb) This dataset covers the Jabodetabek area, employee homecoming time, employee profession, the dominant area of the employee at a time, gender, and age. Thank you to my team (Me, [Rony Agus Vian](https://github.com/vianra), Fransiscus Emmanuel Bunaren) for completing this notebook.
