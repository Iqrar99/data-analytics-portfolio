# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me (and sometimes with my team) for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

  * [Pok√©mon Stats EDA:](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats%20EDA.ipynb) This dataset includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It has been of great use when teaching statistics to kids.
  * [Ramen Ratings EDA:](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ramen-ratings-eda.ipynb) Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale.
  * [Lokasi Mudik Karyawan (In Indonesian Language):](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Lokasi%20Mudik%20Karyawan.ipynb) This dataset covers the Jabodetabek area, employee homecoming time, employee profession, the dominant area of the employee at a time, gender, and age. Thank you to my teammates (Me, [Rony Agus Vian](https://github.com/vianra), [Fransiscus Emmanuel Bunaren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fransiscus-emmanuel-bunaren-ba4084192/)) for completing this notebook.
  * [Student Performance in Exams:](https://github.com/Iqrar99/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/student-performance-in-exams.ipynb) This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects. The inspirations are to understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance. [Acknowledgements](http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams).
